# SN3 APPS code 

## Description
Please use this doc as a debug log and documentation for all code related to the APPS. 
The APPS or "Acceleration Pedal Position Sensor" is a board on our vehicle that controls the
torque to the inverter. 

### 3/8/24 
Changes from SN2 vehicle that need to be implemented in this repository include the HECS sensing 
and the current sensing. There might also need to be a reading from the BSPD reset.
